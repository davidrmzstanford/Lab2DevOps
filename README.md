List of Functionalities:

1. Initialize a Project: Set up a project directory, initialize a Git repository, and create an initial Node.js package (package.json).
2. Create a Node.js Script: Create a basic Node.js script (index.js) that displays a "Hello Node.js!" message in the console.
3. Define NPM Scripts: Define NPM scripts for testing and running the Node.js script.
4. Create a Web Application: Install the Express package and create a minimal web application using Express, serving a "Hello world!" message at the root URL.
5. Create a CHANGELOG.md File: Create a changelog file to document project changes.
